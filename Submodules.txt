Walk me through the process of using submodules.  Note, I have a parent git repo already set up called 'Hostgator' (it's called this because I used to host it on a site called hostgator, but I am currently moving everything over to AWS).  Currently, my 'Hostgator' site, just has some notes and stuff about all of the sites, and also this is where I keep my ssh key (not committed in the repo of course but physically in that location with a .gitignore entry).  Note, my old Hostgator site is about 20 years old and has a dozen or so sites which are mostly just Wordpress sites, but there is some oddball custom endpoints on some of them.  None of them have ever been tracked in version control however so this seems like a good idea.  My main concern is that the sites are still separable.  At the moment, I my plan is to deploy them all on the same EC2 instance, however i can predict in the future I may want to take one or more of them off and put them somewhere else, which is why I would want them in separate repos

Thanks for the context ‚Äî it really helps. Based on your situation, using Git submodules is actually a good idea. It‚Äôll keep your sites logically and physically separate, while allowing you to track them from a central repo (Hostgator) during this transition to AWS.

Let‚Äôs walk through setting up submodules step-by-step.

üß± Your Goal

  * You have a parent repo called Hostgator
  * You want to put each site in its own Git repo, tracked from within Hostgator using submodules
  * You want to be able to eventually detach a site easily
  * You want to deploy all of them on one EC2 instance (for now)

  Perfect use case for submodules.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Add a Site as a Git Submodule

  Let‚Äôs say one of your sites is called my-old-site.com.

üß§ 1. Prepare the Site Directory

  Assuming your sites are already in folders like:

    ~/Hostgator/my-old-site.com/


  You‚Äôll need to:

    * Move that folder out temporarily (just to prevent nesting conflicts)
    * Initialize a new Git repo for it
    * Push it to a new remote (GitHub, CodeCommit, Bitbucket, etc.)
    * Then add it back to Hostgator as a submodule

üß± 2. Create the New Repo for the Site

  Move the site temporarily

    cd ~/Hostgator
    mv my-old-site.com ~/temp-sites/

  Initialize Git for it

    cd ~/temp-sites/my-old-site.com
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of my-old-site.com"

  Push to a new remote (GitHub, etc.)

    Let‚Äôs assume you're using GitHub:

    gh repo create my-old-site.com --private
    # Or create it manually via the GitHub UI

    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/my-old-site.com.git
    git push -u origin main

üîÅ 3. Add the Site Back to Hostgator as a Submodule

  Now go back to Hostgator:

    cd ~/Hostgator
    git submodule add git@github.com:yourusername/my-old-site.com.git my-old-site.com

  This will:
    * Clone the submodule into the my-old-site.com directory
    * Add a line to .gitmodules
    * Stage the new directory and .gitmodules file

  Commit the submodule reference:

    git add .gitmodules my-old-site.com
    git commit -m "Add my-old-site.com as a submodule"
    git push

‚úÖ Done! Now your Hostgator repo tracks the external repo at a specific commit, without mixing the histories.

üß† What This Gets You

  * You can keep all the deployment scripts, notes, and SSH keys in Hostgator
  * Each site is self-contained and can be independently versioned
  * You can deploy all submodules from the parent, or deploy them separately
  * In the future, migrating a site to another server is just cloning its individual repo

üõ†Ô∏è Working with Submodules

  Here are some day-to-day things to know:

  Cloning with submodules

  If someone else clones Hostgator, they need to do:

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:yourusername/Hostgator.git

  Or, if they forget:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

  Updating a submodule (e.g., after making a change inside my-old-site.com)

    cd my-old-site.com
    # make changes
    git add . && git commit -m "Fix something"
    git push

    # Then go back to Hostgator
    cd ..
    git add my-old-site.com
    git commit -m "Update my-old-site.com to latest commit"
    git push

üì¶ Bonus: Deployment from the Hostgator Repo

  Since all your sites live inside the Hostgator structure (as submodules), you could easily write deployment scripts in Hostgator that:
    * Loop through each submodule
    * Pull latest changes
    * Sync files to /var/www/your-site.com using rsync, scp, etc.

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Pitfalls

Problem	                                                        Solution
Forgetting to update submodules after pull	                    Run git submodule update --remote
Accidentally committing changes to submodule                    Always cd into the submodule to work on it
directories in the wrong repo
Harder to collaborate if others aren't familiar                 Provide a simple setup script in the root README
with submodules

‚úÖ TL;DR

You should:
  * Make each site its own Git repo
  * Add them to Hostgator using git submodule add
  * Commit changes to submodules separately
  * Push updates to both the submodule and parent repos

Let me know if you'd like a script to automate adding all the submodules or a sample deployment script for the EC2 instance.
