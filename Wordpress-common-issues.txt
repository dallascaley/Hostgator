ChatGPT question:

I have a wordpress site that is hosted locally. it's just a basic out-of-the-box site with no configuration. I also have a database dump of a real wordpress site which has a bunch of data in it. I downloaded that dump and set up another database in the same host as my local one. I then changed the wp-config of my new basic wordpress site to point at the old database. Now nothing at all works

Answer:

Got it ‚Äî you're trying to take a **local basic WordPress site** and connect it to a **real site's database dump** by switching the database in `wp-config.php`. Since "nothing at all works," let‚Äôs walk through what might be going wrong and how to fix it.

### üîß Likely Issues and Fixes

#### 1. ‚úÖ **Database connection works ‚Äî but the site breaks**

If your `wp-config.php` change points to the real site's database, and *nothing* loads or you get a white screen, the site is probably loading **data (URLs, theme, plugins)** from the real site‚Äôs setup ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt match your local environment.

##### üîç Check #1: **Site URL mismatch**

WordPress stores the site's home URL and site URL **in the database**, not just in `wp-config.php`. So your local site is now trying to load resources from the **real (remote) URL**, causing things to break or redirect endlessly.

**Fix: Temporarily override site URLs in `wp-config.php`**

Add these lines to your `wp-config.php` **above** the `/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */` line:

```php
define('WP_HOME', 'http://localhost/your-folder-name');
define('WP_SITEURL', 'http://localhost/your-folder-name');
```

> Replace `your-folder-name` with your actual local site path, or just `http://localhost` if it's at the root.

#### 2. üß± **Permalinks / .htaccess issues**

If pages aren‚Äôt loading or give 404 errors:

* Go to **Settings ‚Üí Permalinks** in the WordPress dashboard and just click **Save** (this refreshes `.htaccess` rules).
* If you can‚Äôt access the admin, you may need to reset permalinks manually in the database (let me know if needed).

---

#### 3. üé® **Missing theme or plugins**

If the real site's database references themes or plugins that **aren‚Äôt installed locally**, WordPress may fail to load properly or throw errors.

**Fix:**
Install the **same theme and plugins** used on the real site into your local WordPress `wp-content` directory.

#### 4. üßº **Database serialization problems (rare but possible)**

WordPress stores some data (like options) in **serialized PHP arrays**, which break if you do find/replace in the SQL dump. If you've edited the SQL manually, it could corrupt the serialized strings.

**Fix:** Use a tool like [WP-CLI's `search-replace`](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/search-replace/) or [Interconnect/IT‚Äôs Search Replace DB tool](https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/) to safely update URLs in the DB.

### üîç Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

| Check                     | Command or Location                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| DB connection works?      | Does site give DB connection error?               |
| Site loads but redirects? | Add `WP_HOME` and `WP_SITEURL` to `wp-config.php` |
| Theme missing or broken?  | Reinstall theme from live site                    |
| Plugins missing?          | Copy `wp-content/plugins` from real site          |
| Permalinks broken?        | Reset permalinks from admin or database           |

### Bonus: How to view current site URL in the DB

If you can connect to the DB (e.g., via **phpMyAdmin** or **MySQL CLI**), run:

```sql
SELECT option_name, option_value FROM wp_options 
WHERE option_name IN ('siteurl', 'home');
```

This will show you the current URLs WordPress is trying to use.

Let me know:

* What do you see on the screen now? Blank page? Error?
* Can you access `wp-admin`?
* Did you import the real database into a **fresh DB**, or overwrite your local one?

Happy to help you walk through the fix!
