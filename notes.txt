ssh example:

ssh -i C:\Users\dalla\Repo\Hostgator\.ssh\Hostgator-Key-1.pem ec2-user@44.225.148.34

(use your own fucking path)

how did we set this up...

Hmm, lets install a server.  Since this might become a reverse proxy at some point I am going to start with nginx:

sudo amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1
sudo yum install -y nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

sudo dnf install -y nginx
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
sudo dnf install -y php php-fpm php-mysqlnd php-cli php-gd php-xml php-mbstring

and a database:

sudo dnf install -y mariadb105-server
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation

    NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
          SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

    In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
    password for the root user. If you've just installed MariaDB, and
    haven't set the root password yet, you should just press enter here.

    Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
    OK, successfully used password, moving on...

    Setting the root password or using the unix_socket ensures that nobody
    can log into the MariaDB root user without the proper authorisation.

    You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.

    Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] n
    ... skipping.

    You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.

    Change the root password? [Y/n] n
    ... skipping.

    By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
    to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
    them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
    go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
    production environment.

    Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
    ... Success!

    Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
    ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

    Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
    ... skipping.

    By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
    access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
    before moving into a production environment.

    Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
    - Dropping test database...
    ... Success!
    - Removing privileges on test database...
    ... Success!

    Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
    will take effect immediately.

    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
    ... Success!

    Cleaning up...

    All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
    installation should now be secure.

    Thanks for using MariaDB!

Log in and create a user

sudo mysql -u root -p

CREATE DATABASE site1_db;
CREATE USER 'site1_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'site1_pass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON site1_db.* TO 'site1_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

Download wordpress
cd /whatever-site
curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz

Set ownership
sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/site1.com


Make nginx conf

sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/site1.com.conf

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name site1.com www.site1.com;

    root /var/www/site1.com;
    index index.php index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/www.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}

restart nginx

sudo systemctl restart nginx

bunch of shit i should have written down, basically I asked GPT how to set up a wordpress site
and it worked. I got dallascaley.info working with a basic default wordpress.  not rocket science
here

Next step, need to create an FTP user so wordpress can update it's own plugins.

connect to your instance:

ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip

install this shit:

sudo yum install vsftpd -y

Start and enable this crap even though you don't know what the fuck it is.

sudo systemctl start vsftpd
sudo systemctl enable vsftpd

Create new FTP user

sudo adduser ftpuser
sudo passwd ftpuser

FUCK!  I should have read the gpt instructions before actually doing anything. here they are:

    5. Create FTP Directory & Set Permissions

        sudo mkdir -p /home/ftpuser/ftp/files
        sudo chown nobody:nogroup /home/ftpuser/ftp
        sudo chmod a-w /home/ftpuser/ftp
        sudo chown ftpuser:ftpuser /home/ftpuser/ftp/files

    6. Configure vsftpd

        Open the config file:

        sudo nano /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf


        Make sure these values are set (uncomment if needed):

        anonymous_enable=NO
        local_enable=YES
        write_enable=YES
        chroot_local_user=YES
        allow_writeable_chroot=YES
        user_sub_token=$USER
        local_root=/home/$USER/ftp


        Add this at the bottom if not present:

        pasv_min_port=30000
        pasv_max_port=31000


        Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

    7. Restart vsftpd

        sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

    8. Adjust Firewall / Security Groups

        In the AWS EC2 console:

        Go to Security Groups

        Edit inbound rules to allow:

        TCP Port 21 (FTP)

        TCP Ports 30000–31000 (Passive FTP)

        Optional: TCP 20 (FTP data transfer)

    9. Test FTP Connection

        Use an FTP client like FileZilla or WinSCP with:

        Host: your EC2 public IP

        Port: 21

        Protocol: FTP

        Username: ftpuser

        Password: the one you set

        Passive mode: enabled

    🔐 Optional (Highly Recommended): Use SFTP Instead

    FTP transmits credentials in plain text. Consider using SFTP (via SSH) instead. It's enabled by default for all system users.

    You can use the same user (ftpuser) and connect with SFTP (port 22) without setting up vsftpd at all.

    Would you prefer setting up SFTP instead for better security?

Translation, here's the fucking stupid way to do it, would you like to know the better way?


yes, how can i set up SFTP?  (and is that the same as FTPS as it is referred to in the Wordpress setup)

ChatGPT said:

Great choice — SFTP is much more secure than plain FTP.

✅ SFTP vs FTPS (WordPress context)

    Term    Meaning             Secure?     Port                 Used by WordPress?
    SFTP    SSH File Transfer   ✅ Yes      22	               ✅ Yes
            Protocol               (via SSH)
    FTPS    FTP over SSL/TLS    ✅ Yes      990 (implicit)      ✅ Yes
            (FTP Secure)                     or 21 (explicit)
    FTP     Plain old FTP       ❌ No       21	               ✅ Yes (but insecure)

    👉 SFTP and FTPS are different protocols.

    In WordPress, when it asks for FTPS, it's often confusing — it may actually support SFTP under the hood depending on your server setup.

🔐 Set Up SFTP on AWS EC2 (Recommended)

    SFTP works out-of-the-box via SSH on Linux EC2 instances.

🎯 Goal

    Set up a dedicated SFTP-only user (no shell access).

    Limit user access to a specific directory (like /var/www/html for WordPress uploads).

🛠️ Step-by-Step SFTP Setup

    1. Create a User

        sudo adduser sftpuser
        sudo passwd sftpuser

2. Create and Assign a Directory

    Let's say you want the user to access /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads:

        sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
        sudo chown root:root /var/www/html/wp-content
        sudo chown sftpuser:sftpuser /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads

🔐 The uploads folder must be owned by the user. The parent directory (wp-content) must be owned by root for chroot to work properly.

3. Restrict SFTP User to SFTP Only

    Edit the SSH config:

        sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    Add at the bottom (or modify if exists):

        Match User sftpuser
            ChrootDirectory /var/www/html/wp-content
            ForceCommand internal-sftp
            AllowTcpForwarding no
            X11Forwarding no


    🔁 Explanation:

        Restricts user to SFTP only

        Chroots to /var/www/html/wp-content, so they only see /uploads

4. Restart SSH

    sudo systemctl restart sshd

5. Test SFTP

    Use an SFTP client (like FileZilla or Cyberduck) with:

     * Protocol: SFTP
     * Host: your EC2 public IP
     * Port: 22
     * Username: sftpuser
     * Password: the one you set

    You should land directly in the uploads/ directory.

✅ Bonus: Set SFTP in WordPress

    When WordPress prompts for connection info:

     * Connection Type: select SFTP
     * Hostname: your EC2 public IP
     * Username: sftpuser
     * Password: password you set
     * Port: 22

    If you want to skip this screen entirely, you can define these in wp-config.php:

    define('FS_METHOD', 'ssh2');
    define('FTP_USER', 'sftpuser');
    define('FTP_PASS', 'yourpassword');
    define('FTP_HOST', 'your-ec2-ip:22');
    define('FTP_BASE', '/var/www/html/');

🔐 Important Security Note

 * The SFTP user cannot upload outside the chroot directory (/var/www/html/wp-content).
 * Do not give this user sudo or shell access unless needed.
 * Use key-based auth if possible instead of a password (for stronger security).

Would you like help switching to key-based authentication for your SFTP user?


in our last session I had this request:

everything is working great so far.  Currently the inventory page only 
scans dirty files, dirty lines of code, dirty tables and dirty database 
rows.  I would like to also add all the clean versions of all of those 
things in a new row on the inventory page (put the clean ones on top and 
the dirty ones underneath).  In order to do this, we will need to add a 
flag to each database table to indicate dirty or clean (is dirty true 
false).  and then make all the other necessary changes.  For the api 
endpoints, I am hoping we can extend the current code rather than making 
new functions becasue most of the functionality will be the same

However I ran out of credits, can you check to see how far we got here and complete whatever is remaining?

robot died while trying to get socket connections aligned into one endpoint so it's not retarded.
