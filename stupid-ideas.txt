Contract vs Permanent job comparison

PR = Permanent Rate (or equivalent with Salary)
CR = Contract Rate

I = Is it worth it?  (positive values indicate yes, negative values indicate no)

SETA = Self Employment Tax Adjustment (aka the percentage extra you will have to pay because you are self employed)

       example: if 110/hour contract is like making 100/hour permanent then SETA = 100/110 = .9090_

CUR = Contract Unemployment Rate.  This number is determined by guessing how long your average contract job lasts
      and then dividing that by the same length plus how long you expect to be out of work between contract jobs

      example: Typical contract lasts 1 year (aka 12 months),  typically out of work 3 months = 12 / 12 + 3 = .8

PUR = Permanent Unemployment Rate.  This number is how long your average permanent position lasts devided by that length
      plus how long you expect to be out of work between permanent positions

      example: Typical permanent job length 4 years, out of work 1 month = 48 / 48 + 1 = .9796

     CR * SETA * CUR
I = -----------------
        PR * PUR


Other ideas that could be thrown into this calculation:

  1) Risk tolerance.  How tolerant are you of risk?  Generally people become less tolerant of risk as they get older.

     If risk tolerance changes over time, what is the average curve of this change and can we guess what it might be
     for anyone given their age/years in the industry

  2) What other benefits are there of contract and permanent rolls

     Specifically, what are those benefits worth?  What is healtcare actually worth, flexible hours etc...
