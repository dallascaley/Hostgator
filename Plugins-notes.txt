Migrating old WordPress sites — especially those that have accumulated plugins over 16+ years — can be tricky. Your instincts are right to be cautious about plugins during the migration.

Let’s break down your two core questions and then discuss some additional considerations.

---

### ✅ A) **Can WordPress Plugins Add Tables/Fields to the Database?**

**Yes.** Plugins can and often do:

#### 1. **Create New Tables**

* Many complex plugins (e.g., eCommerce, membership, SEO, analytics) create their own tables to store custom data.
* These tables usually have a prefix like `wp_pluginname_*`, but not always — especially in older plugins.

#### 2. **Add Fields (Columns) to Existing Tables**

* Some plugins modify existing core WordPress tables (like `wp_users` or `wp_posts`) to store additional data. This is less common today but was more frequent in older plugins.

#### 3. **Use the `wp_options` Table**

* Many plugins store their settings in the `wp_options` table under an option name (e.g., `pluginname_settings`).
* Some also store transient data, caches, or version numbers here.

#### 4. **Use `postmeta`, `usermeta`, and `termmeta` Tables**

* For extending post/user/term content, plugins often use WordPress's meta tables.
* If a plugin adds fields to pages/posts (like SEO metadata), it likely lives in `wp_postmeta`.

### ✅ B) **What to Consider with Plugin Migration**

When migrating sites and plugins, here’s what you should think about:

---

#### 1. **Full File + Database Backup**

* **Files**: Copy the entire site directory, including:

  * `/wp-content/plugins/` – Plugin code.
  * `/wp-content/uploads/` – Media and plugin-generated files (some plugins store files here).
  * `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` – Must-use plugins (less common, but check).
  * Sometimes plugins create their own subdirectories like `/wp-content/cache/`, `/wp-content/pluginname_data/`, etc.

* **Database**: Dump the full database (all tables) using `mysqldump` or a tool like phpMyAdmin. Be careful not to exclude tables unless you're sure they are unused.

---

#### 2. **Database Integrity: Look for orphaned or abandoned plugin data**

* Over 16 years, some plugins were probably removed but left behind data.
* Use tools like **Plugins Garbage Collector** or **WP-Optimize** to identify orphaned tables and rows.
* Consider documenting or exporting a list of custom tables for review.

---

#### 3. **Plugin Compatibility (Post-Migration)**

* Some plugins might **not be compatible** with your current PHP or WordPress version.
* After migration, check:

  * PHP error logs
  * Plugin support pages for known issues
  * Use tools like [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) to debug problems

---

#### 4. **Licensing and Activation**

* Some premium plugins may need reactivation or license re-entry on the new server.
* If domain names or server IPs change, this might affect plugin behavior.

---

#### 5. **Scheduled Tasks (CRON Jobs)**

* Some plugins use WP-Cron to run background tasks.
* If you're moving to a new server, ensure that cron is working or set up a real cron job for reliability:

  ```bash
  */5 * * * * wget -q -O - https://yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```

---

#### 6. **Security / Abandonware**

* Many old plugins may be insecure or abandoned.
* Use tools like:

  * [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/) for plugin vulnerability scanning
  * [Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/) for firewall and scans
  * Check plugin update history in the WP dashboard or [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/)

---

### 🧠 Additional Tips

* **Use a staging environment** on the new server to test everything first.
* Consider doing some **plugin auditing**:

  * Deactivate unnecessary plugins.
  * Replace outdated ones with modern alternatives.
* Automate parts of this with **WP-CLI** if you’re comfortable with the command line.
